* this is my final project of high performance router desigh course
* Reference paper: Compact TCAM- Flow Entry Compaction in TCAM for Power Aware SDN
## description:
* topo.sh: mininet topology laucher
* ryu_exe.sh: Ryu controller laucher
* line_topo.py: mininet topology generator
* compact.py: the target Ryu application
* mapping.py: the file included by compact.py, recording some configuration
* mapping.log: log file generated by mapping.py

* this application will match the ping flow between hosts,
* at the ingress switch, they match src_ip, dst_ip, src_mac, dst_mac, ip protocol of the ping packet
* if matched, packets will be inserted a vlan tag
* then in the following routing, switches just need to match this specific vlan ID and then forwarding
* at egress switch, the vlan tag will be remove before packets are sent to the host

## environment:
* OS:Linux
* emulater:mininet
* controller:Ryu

## usage
* sh topo.sh # activate mininet
* sh ryu_exe.sh # acctivate Ryu
